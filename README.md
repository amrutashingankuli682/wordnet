# Synonyms and Antonyms Finder

This web application built with Flask allows users to find synonyms and antonyms for a given word using the NLTK library and WordNet database. It features a simple user interface where users can input a word, and the application fetches and displays related synonyms and antonyms.

## Features

- Input a word and find its synonyms and antonyms.
- Display results side by side in a user-friendly format.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: Python web framework for building the backend server.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Python library for natural language processing tasks.
- WordNet: Lexical database for the English language, used to find synonyms and antonyms.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/synonyms-antonyms-finder.git
   cd synonyms-antonyms-finder
   ```

2. Install dependencies. Make sure you have Python and pip installed:

   ```bash
   pip install flask nltk
   ```

3. Download NLTK resources. Run Python in your terminal:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the application.
